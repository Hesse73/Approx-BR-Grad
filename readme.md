# Approx BR Gradient

Source code for: *Learning Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in Auction Games via Approximate Best Response*

To run experiment codes, use the script in the directory `./script/`.

Take the main experiment as an example:
```bash
# Run the main experiment with Utility Grad & Approx BR Grad methods
bash ./script/run_main_exp.sh
# Run the main experiment with SM method
bash ./script/run_main_sm.sh
```
